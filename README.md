# dotodo - A simple todo app with a nice UI.

### So yeah...

I wanted to make a simple todo app that had a nice premium looking UI without the premium price. I wanted to make it as fluid as possible.

## Todo:

 1. Add Settings view -> just add a logout button for now and then start main Firebase integration
 2. Fix weird swiping on CustomRootTabViewController. (we need to implement velocity in some way)
 3. Make Tasks view better and add more functionality
 4. Make Calendar view better and add more functionality

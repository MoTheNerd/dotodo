> I don't really know what to put here yet so give me a bit... Yes, this is still being built.

## Todo:

 1. Add Settings view -> just add a logout button for now and then start main Firebase integration
 2. Fix weird swiping on CustomRootTabViewController. (we need to implement velocity in some way)
 3. Make Tasks view better and add more functionality
 4. Make Calendar view better and add more functionality
